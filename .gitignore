# Terminology - 
# TRACKED means the repo is fully tracked by git
# WARNING_COMP means that this folder is not tracked by GIT (file limit) but you need to download it manually for a working
# compilation

# app

# buildroot 
# TRACKED


# device
# TRACKED
# here all the BoardConfig.mk files are stored. Small, keep it in


# docs 
# TRACKED
# git doesn't like big pdfs. But aparently buying git premium or something fixed the issues i had with last repo


# external
# this one is tricky. On the one hand, I do a lot of work here. On the other hand, some of the directories have
# hughe files ( would need git lfs for that, but git lfs sucks). So do not track the couple ones that have "too big" files,
# but leave the rest in
# These directories have some stupid big files (Neural network-s) and we don't need them anyways
# run locally find -type f -size +99M and pasted output here
